IMPORTANT: Lombok

If, after importing the projects into your IDE, you see errors complaining about missing getters, setters, constructors, or log instance variables, it’s because Lombok is not installed in your IDE. These bits of code will be generated by Lombok automatically, but your IDE doesn’t know that and complains that they are missing.

To fix the errors, simply install Lombok. Lombok has support for most common (and arguably a few uncommon) IDEs, so no matter which IDE you use, you should be covered. See https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview for details on installing Lombok in your IDE.
